[[https://github.com/lutris/lutris][Lutris]] YAML script(s) for installing [[https://pixologic.com/features/about-zbrush.php][ZBrush]] on a GNU/Linux operating system.

* Installation
To install ZBrush, first make sure that you have downloaded the installer from your Pixologic account.

Clone this repository to a path of your choice, and invoke Lutris with:

#+begin_src bash
lutris -i /absolute/path/to/installation-script.yml
#+end_src

where ~installation-script.yml~ is a filename of YAML script for a specific ZBrush version. Currently, only one is supported, so there aren't many versions to choose from.

You will be asked to specify installation path where you want Wineprefix to reside in, and a path to the downloaded ZBrush installer executable.

Using Winetricks, Lutris installer will automatically pull Visual C++ runtime libraries that I think are required for the proper functioning of ZBrush. If you believe those libraries are not necessary and ZBrush works perfectly fine without them, let me know.

ZBrush installer executable will detect that a newer version of VC runtime 2008 libraries is already installed. Just click the /Cancel/ button. It will also install VC2017, for which there are already overrides present created by winetricks. Don't cancel this one, let it proceed.

* What works and what doesn't
Everything seems to be working properly. Intuos pen pressure works, as well as both ZRemesher algorithms. Even the elusive Lightbox.

Performance is great, though I'm unable to compare it with ZBrush running on a native Windows machine, as none of my workstations has this OS.

For obvious reasons, you can probably forget about AppLinks.

Quitting ZBrush will cause the whole desktop to freeze for a couple of seconds (at least the XFCE I tested it on). Once the program shuts down, desktop environment will be responsive again.
